## Searching for imbalanced Velodrome V1 pools

A few weeks ago I noticed that due to Velodrome migrating to V2, V1 pools become a bit forgotten and might become imbalanced, which means that there can be arbitrage opportunities.

Yesterday + today I wrote some scripts and did a research of those 604 Velodrome V1 pools.

But, as you can probably guess, nothing was found :((

There was one pool that looked promising: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf8eDF2Da8FcF610Cf77235D3F90CC110723159Aa#readContract. I found it yesterday and was really hoping to profit by about ~$5 there. At least checking the contract state and the prices for which I could buy / sell this pool's tokens on other platforms gave me a belief.

However yesterday I didn't finish the scheme and while I was sleeping... Somebody swapped tokens using that pool and brought it back to balance :(( And I have not found any other potential pools :((( Such a sad story :(((((
